# Planning Session 1/9/2017
- USB define themselves by supplying code
  - exec javascript that is passed by the device to the server
  - may also have to supply GUI
- Scope creep!!! (we must define the scope)
  - RFID 
  - Extensibility wrt devices, external APIs
  - How to distinguish my platform (specifically automated connection) from other home automation devices
  - do archetecture diagrams of each of the initial device connection ideas
- Primus
- No more than 3 devices

#### Software archetects (tangent)
  - in the end, it is managment
    - some archetects are too loose in parameters
    - some archetects are too detailed
  - Diagrams
  - When delegating, farm out as many jobs as possible, that you dont want to do, as long as the quality of the outsource is no less than 80% of your own.

**device:** a physical mcu which has a deviceType
**deviceType:** A description of a physical server connection that a user can identify it with
**controllerType:** 

#### Tasks
